# On our Arch desktop that uses xfce4-screensaver, 'systemctl suspend' is
# sufficient for a proper suspend:
#
# - to be awoken once suspended by pressing shortly the user main ON button on
# the front of the computer case (hitting the keyboard having no effect)
#
# - with (1) a proper lock screen being displayed when returning from
# suspension, and (2) everything being then restored as normal, from OpenGL to
# the network
#
# Seen too many errors with GDBus and SessionManager failing to lock the screen
# despite much installation/configuration efforts, whereas the solution used
# here works great, at least in the contexts tested.
