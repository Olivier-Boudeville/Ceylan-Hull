![](/doc/hull-title.png)

This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering a collection of all kinds of shell scripts.

Please refer to the [Hull official documentation](http://hull.esperide.org), otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/Ceylan-Hull/).

The 'master' branch is aimed to correspond to the current stable version of this script collection.
