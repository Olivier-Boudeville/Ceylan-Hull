usage="
Usage: $(basename $0) [-h|--help] <a directory entry name>: renames the specified file or directory to a 'corrected' filesystem entry name, i.e., among other fixes: without spaces or quotes, replaced by '-', with no accentuated characters in it.

At least usually running this script once is sufficient.

See also fix-paths-in-tree.sh for a multifile, recursive version thereof.
